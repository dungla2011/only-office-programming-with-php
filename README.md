This part is a very basic Demo of integrating OnlyOffice Document Server into your App (Web, CMS).

The free Community version allows ~20 users to use at the same time, enough for most small groups.

From here you can allow collaborative work (edit files together), limit access to documents...

We support providing VPS DocumentServer Onlyoffice to ensure good performance, data safety and security for you if needed.
